# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application
  With the CLI the user is able to engage with a menu that lists the breweries of Durango.
- [x] Pull data from an external source
  I used the site `http://www.durango.org/listings/category/microbreweries` to scrape information on each brewery. With this, the user is able to retrieve simple information such as the address, telephone number and a short description.
- [x] Implement both list and detail views
  The method #list_breweries is in the CLI that greets the user then lists the breweries in Durango. The user can then gain more details of the brewery by selecting a number corresponding to the specific brewery.
